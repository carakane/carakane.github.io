I"-<p>Implementing a jQuery frontend on my <a href="https://github.com/carakane/volunteer_manager/tree/jquery">Volunteer Manager</a> Rails application was in some ways a more complex undertaking than making the application to begin with. To start with, although I’m fairly comfortable with errors, there’s a big difference between fixing something that’s broken and breaking something that’s working and then fixing it! I liked the flow of my application, and adding the jQuery frontend involved a lot of problem creation and then problem solving.</p>
