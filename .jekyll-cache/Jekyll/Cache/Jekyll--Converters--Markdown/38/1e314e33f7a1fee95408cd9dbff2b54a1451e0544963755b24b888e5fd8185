I"j<p>As we’ve gotten farther into our exploration of Sinatra, many of the tests have been written using <a href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara">Capybara</a>. The Capybara gem allows us to formulate tests that mimic how a user interacts with the DOM. These are known as “integration tests.” This adds a lot of functionality to our testing abilities because instead of just testing what is literally in the code, we can also test what the code actually creates. Capybara tests can mimic filling in forms, clicking buttons, navigating to pages, checking and unchecking buttons, and other user actions.</p>
