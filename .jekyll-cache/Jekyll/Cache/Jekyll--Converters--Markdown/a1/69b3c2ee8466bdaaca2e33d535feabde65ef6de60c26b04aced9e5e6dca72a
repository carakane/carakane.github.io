I")<p>Our third Flatiron portfolio project is a complete Rails application. My project, <a href="https://github.com/carakane/volunteer_manager">Volunteer Manager</a>, is an application that allows users to assign volunteers to volunteer opportunities at their organizations. From a userâ€™s perspective, the app is fairly straightforward: they are able to create a password-protected account or sign in via Facebook. They then add to their account the organizations under their purview and the opportunities available at those organizations. The opportunities use days of the week as a basic availability measure. Volunteers can be added to a sitewide database and share the same availability measure. Users can view all the volunteers and can then assign one available on the same day as their opportunity.</p>
