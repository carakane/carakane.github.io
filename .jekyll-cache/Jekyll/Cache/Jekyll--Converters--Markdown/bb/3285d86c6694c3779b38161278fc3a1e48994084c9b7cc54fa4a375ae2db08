I"X<p>Those people who are privileged enough to have space in their lives to make employment choices seem to fall into two camps: those who choose careers that they love and those who get jobs. The former have a driving passion for something and make that passion the foundation of their life’s work. The latter don’t operate in that way, and pursue jobs that appeal to them and then eventually move on to a different job, often appealing in a different way. Neither of these groups is necessarily more satisfied with their work than the other, they just approach the process in different ways.</p>
