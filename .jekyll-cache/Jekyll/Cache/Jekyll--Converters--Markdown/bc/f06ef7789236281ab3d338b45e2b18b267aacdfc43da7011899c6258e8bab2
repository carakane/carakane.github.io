I"Ó<p>This week I went to a talk by <a href="http://catheraaine.com/">Catherine Meade</a> of <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/">Sparkbox</a>, who discussed GitHub pulls and how to better engage and document GitHub pull requests when working on a team, especially a team that includes people who respond well to different kinds of thinking or information processing (e.g., visual vs. textual). Cat is an engaging speaker and offered a lot of useful resources that we might use to improve our communication and collaboration. Sheâ€™ll be offering the talk again at <a href="http://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash</a> and <a href="https://2018.jsconf.is/">JSConf Iceland</a>, and if youâ€™re there you should check out her talk!</p>
