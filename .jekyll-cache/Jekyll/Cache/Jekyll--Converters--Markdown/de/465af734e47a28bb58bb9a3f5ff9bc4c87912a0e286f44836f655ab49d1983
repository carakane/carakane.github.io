I"Q<p>For my final project, a single-page React/Redux/Rails web application, I made a trivia game. The Jeopardy fanbase maintains an archive of questions from the famous game show, and, luckily, thereâ€™s an API for it! My project pulls data from the <a href="http://jservice.io/">jservice API</a> (in the form of questions) and pushes data to my Rails API (in the form of persisted games), both via fetch. A user is able to play a ten-question game and then submit their initials to the record of High Scores. The app is styled with a combination of react-bootstrap and some additional CSS.</p>
