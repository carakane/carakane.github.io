I"¿<p>Those people who are privileged enough to have space in their lives to make employment choices seem to fall into two camps: those who choose careers that they love and those who get jobs. The former have a driving passion for something and make that passion the foundation of their lifeâ€™s work. The latter donâ€™t operate in that way, and pursue jobs that appeal to them and then eventually move on to a different job, often appealing in a different way. Neither of these groups is necessarily more satisfied with their work than the other, they just approach the process in different ways.</p>

<p>For a long time, Iâ€™ve felt like a member of the latter group. Iâ€™ve loved so many things, but have never loved one thing to the point of wanting it to be a career. In college when it came time to choose a major, I chose an interdisciplinary one, because it felt more comfortable to narrow the focus of my studies than to narrow the methodologies I used to do the work. When I began working I started in marketing for a startup and then eventually moved on to the editing side of academic publishing: lots of writing, followed by lots of reading.</p>

<p>The past few years, as I geared up to reenter the workforce after taking time off to have children, I gave a lot of thought to what kind of career or job I would pursue. Endless amounts of thought, almost. And then, in the winter of this year, I stumbled across the introductions to JavaScript and Ruby at Flatiron. Iâ€™m not completely new to computer programming, but something about it just clicked when I started the Flatiron courses. I began to think about the aspects of my previous jobs that appealed to meâ€”the creativity of marketing, the attention to detail of manuscript editing, and the problem solving required of bothâ€”and I realized that these qualities were all encapsulated by programming.</p>

<p>Although getting a job as a developer is my goal upon completing the program, what draws me to this work is less the job potential and more the actual experience of coding. I have found it to be one of the most absorbing and enjoyable challenges Iâ€™ve ever attempted, and Iâ€™m thrilled to have found a career, especially one which requires such tenacity.</p>
