<p>Currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Developer program at the Flatiron School, I'm looking forward to starting my programming career in Fall 2017. After taking a break to have children, I'm thrilled to have found work that I feel passionately about, and that requires such tenacity and creativity. My Flatiron education delves into HTML, CSS, OOP, Ruby, SQL, ORM, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, and JSON.</p>
